# See what keeps going wrong

When something goes wrong for you, it usually shows up in one of a few ways: you reopen a request, an agent closes your request without doing what you asked, or agents fail to hand work to each other. Until now these happened in different parts of AgentX and nobody counted them.

AgentX now records each of them as a **failure signal**: one line with what happened, which agent, which request or hand-off, and when. Recording a signal uses no AI model and costs nothing. This is the first step of letting AgentX improve itself: count first, then fix the few problems that keep coming back.

## What is counted

| Signal | When it is recorded |
|---|---|
| `owner_reopened` | You reopen a request an agent had closed, for example with a comment on its post in the Hub. |
| `owner_check_mismatch` | The [owner-words check](./open-requests.md#when-someone-else-closes-your-request-the-owner-words-check) found that a close did not do what you asked, and reopened it. |
| `request_stalled` | A request needs attention: its work failed, timed out, was cut off, or went quiet. |
| `handoff_refused` | An agent's hand-off to another agent was refused: the [hand-off budget](./ask-another-agent.md) was used up, the hand-off would have looped back, or a person's permissions did not allow it. |
| `delegation_failed` | A hand-off ended in an error, ran out of time, or was lost in a restart. |
| `callback_repeat_skipped` | A helper agent wrote its answer, then ended its run with the same answer again. The repeat was not passed on. |
| `same_work_waited` | The same request reached an agent twice while one of its runs was already on it, so the second waited. |

The same signal about the same request or hand-off within 10 minutes is counted once. Signals are kept for 90 days.

## See the counts

1. **Terminal:** go to the folder that holds `agentx.json`.
2. **Terminal:** run `agentx improve signals`. It shows the last 24 hours:
   - **By kind:** how many of each signal.
   - **By agent:** which agents they came from.
   - **Seen more than once:** the same problem, with the same words, more than once. These are the ones worth fixing first.
3. **Terminal:** to look further back, add `--since 7d` (or `48h`, `30m`, or a date such as `2026-11-01`).
4. **Terminal:** to list the lines of one kind, add `--kind <kind>`, for example `agentx improve signals --kind owner_reopened --since 7d`.
5. **Terminal:** for a script, add `--json`.

## What comes next

Counting is stage 1. The plan, in order, is to rank the problems that recur, hand the worst one each day to a [retro](./retro.md) (which proposes fixes on one decision card for you to pick), and then check that the picked fix lowered its count. Each stage runs on a fixed daily budget.

## Check it worked

1. **Browser:** on the Hub, write a comment on a request that an agent closed. The request opens again.
2. **Terminal:** run `agentx improve signals --kind owner_reopened`. The request is listed with the agent and your comment.
3. **Terminal:** run `agentx improve signals --since 7d`. The totals by kind and by agent are shown, or `none in this window` on a quiet install.

## If something is wrong

- **`no agentx.json here`:** run the command from the install folder, the one that holds `agentx.json`.
- **Every count is zero:** signals are only recorded since this version. Check with `agentx --version`, then wait for some work to happen.
- **No hand-off signals appear:** hand-off signals are recorded by the running daemon. Restart it after updating so the new version records them.
- **`--since must look like …`:** use a number with `d`, `h` or `m` (for example `7d`), or a date.
